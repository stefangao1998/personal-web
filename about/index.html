        <p>As a research student at <strong>UNSW with CSIRO Data61's</strong> scientiest Dr Dilum Bandara and Dr
          Christopher
          Klinkmueller, Stefan conducted conjunctive thesis research on blockchain
          data analysis. The research focused on integrating tools and packages for different stages of Ethereum data
          processing
          as a whole, and implementing a pipeline with analysis capabilities such as visualisation and data processing.
          Stefan's responsibilities included:
        <ul>
          <li>designing and developing a tool that provided a web-based analytics
            dashboard for using process discovery to analyse smart contracts deployed on Ethereum</li>
          <li>data
            extraction, data pre-processing, and data visualisation and analysis</li>
          <li>integrated open-source tools to speed up and ease the analysis process</li>
          The interface was built with ReactJS, D3.js as the frontend
          and NodeJS as the backend, with smart contracts written in solidity.
        </ul>

        Stefan also take part in developed an

        Bluetooth Low
        Energy(BLE) device to auto-connect, track device position,
        GNSS Positioning, monitor the trace and behaviour. The frontend was developed using React Native based on
        Redux, Umi, and React-Native-BLE-Manager.
